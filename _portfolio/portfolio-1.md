I started my photography journey around 2009. Afterwards, I got my formal training in photography and did a course from Photographic Association of Dumdum.

I am a nature and wildlife photography enthusiast and fond of capturing animals in their wild habitat. Some of these photographs are captured during my fieldwork days in Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve. You can check-out more of my work [here](https://www.alamy.com/portfolio/nilanjan_photography/).
