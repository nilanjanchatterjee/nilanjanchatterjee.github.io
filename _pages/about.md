Hi, I am a Post-Doctoral Fellow at the [Senckenberg Biodiversity and Climate Research Institute](https://www.senckenberg.de/en/institutes/sbik-f/). Previously I have worked as a Post-doctoral Associate at the University of Minnesota. My research interest lies in understanding natural world better with statistical models. With my educational background of Statistics and working experience in ecology, I like to bridge the gap with interdisciplinary research. My research expertise encompasses a range of subject areas in ecology, including the development of methods for analysing animal movement and population trend, bird community ecology focusing on phylogeny, traits, and environmental variables. My current research focuses on modelling species interactions with anthropogenic features, using species movement data. I want to pursue my future research in the interface of statistics and ecology for species conservation and management.


About Me
======
I look forward to developing methodological innovations to design studies targeted for different animals. For my Phd I estimated population of unmarked terrestrial mammal species photo-captured in motion-triggered camera-traps. I graduated from the [Indian Statitical Institute](https://www.isical.ac.in/) with a MS in Statistics in 2013. After that, I joined a project on long-term monitoring of tigers and co-predators at Widllife Institute of India. Currently, I live in the city of Dehradun at the foothills of the Himalaya. 
I am also an R enthusiast and have been teaching Undergraduate and PhD students about the basics of R programming.
                        I am also a wildlife photography enthusiast and fond of capturing animals in their wild habitat. More details about this hobby can be found in the [Portfolio](https://nilanjanchatterjee.github.io/portfolio/) section of the site.
In my spare time, you'll find me trvelling, hiking or climbing in the mountains, capturing the nature through my camera, watching birds, or cooking.


			

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
