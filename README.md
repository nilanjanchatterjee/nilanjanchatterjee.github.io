**Welcome to my Homepage**

# Getting Started

I am a Post-Doctoral Fellow at the Senckenberg Biodiversity and Climate Research Institute (https://www.senckenberg.de/en/institutes/sbik-f/). Previously I have worked as a Post-doctoral Associate at the University of Minnesota. My research interest lies in understanding natural world better with statistical models. With my educational background of Statistics and working experience in ecology,
I like to bridge the gap with interdisciplinary research. My research expertise encompasses a range of subject areas in ecology,
including the development of methods for analysing animal movement and population trend, bird community ecology focusing on phylogeny, traits, and environmental
variables. My current research focuses on modelling species interactions with anthropogenic features, using species movement data. I want to pursue my future
research in the interface of statistics and ecology for species conservation and management.
 
## More details

When you are initially working your website, it is very useful to be able to preview the changes locally before pushing them to GitHub. To work locally you will need to:

1. Clone the repository and made updates as detailed above.
1. Make sure you have ruby-dev, bundler, and nodejs installed
    
    On most Linux distribution and [Windows Subsystem Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) the command is:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install ruby-dev ruby-bundler nodejs
    ```
    On MacOS the commands are:
    ```bash
    brew install ruby
    brew install node
    gem install bundler
    ```
1. Run `bundle install` to install ruby dependencies. If you get errors, delete Gemfile.lock and try again.
1. Run `jekyll serve -l -H localhost` to generate the HTML and serve it from `localhost:4000` the local server will automatically rebuild and refresh the pages on change.

If you are running on Linux it may be necessary to install some additional dependencies prior to being able to run locally: `sudo apt install build-essential gcc make`

## Using Docker

Working from a different OS, or just want to avoid installing dependencies? You can use the provided `Dockerfile` to build a container that will run the site for you if you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed.

Start by build the container:

```bash
docker build -t jekyll-site .
```

Next, run the container:
```bash
docker run -p 4000:4000 --rm -v $(pwd):/usr/src/app jekyll-site
```
